        <p>I enjoyed my first-time coding HTML. I was able to learn about headings, paragraphs, ordered and unodered list</p>

        <p>Upon completing the CSS practice project, my initial challenge was adding semi-colons. Though, it's simplistic to do, the fact that you have to do it after every statement makes it repetitive, thus I forget to put it there.  However, I did gain great experience learning to change fonts, add colors, etc.</p>

        <p>Mistakes? Forgot to close some tags properly, messed up the indenting, and flubbed the !DOCTYPE declaration.Used percentages to size images, so they adjusted to their container. Handy for keeping things looking good across different screens. Pixels, though? Made images stay the same size no matter what. Consistent, sure, but not always the best fit. Like my images had a fixed size, not as flexible.</p>
